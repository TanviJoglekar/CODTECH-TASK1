Project Overview
Project Name: Student Grade Tracker
Objective:
To develop a Python-based application that tracks and manages student grades by calculating the average score, determining letter grades, and computing GPA based on user inputs. The program also evaluates whether the student passes or fails.

Key Activities:
1)Input Collection:
Gathering subject-wise marks for courses like Mathematics, Design Engineering, C Programming, English, and a practical component.
2)Grade Calculation:
Calculating the average marks based on the scores entered for five subjects.
Determining the letter grade (A to F) based on the calculated average.
Converting the letter grade to a corresponding GPA value.
3)Result Generation:
Displaying a well-structured report summarizing marks for each subject, average, letter grade, GPA, and pass/fail status.
4)Validation:
Ensuring user input is numerical and within an acceptable range (manual validation by the user for this implementation

Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Concepts:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Functions and Methods
Conditional Logic
Built-in Python Features:
Input and Output Handling
Data Structures (Dictionaries)
Basic Math Operations

Output:
A tabular or console-based Student Grade Report displaying:
Marks for each subject and practical.
Calculated average marks.
Corresponding letter grade.
Computed GPA.
Final result as "Pass" or "Fail."
